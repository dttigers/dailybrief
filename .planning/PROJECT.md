# Vigil — Ambient AI Life Assistant

## Current State: v3.2 Phase 90 shipped — Server-side persistence live (2026-04-16)

**v3.2 progress:**
- **Phase 90 Server-Side Persistence** — ai_cache table (Drizzle/Postgres), GET cache endpoints for Insights/Therapy, POST upsert cache-write, PWA cache-first hooks with Regenerate, Chat auto-resumes last session
- **Phase 89 7-Day Analysis Scope** — Insights + Therapy routes scoped to 7-day rolling window
- **Phase 88 Date Window Helper & Weekly Rollover** — Wed-anchored week helper in vigil-core; `GET /thoughts` defaults to current week with `?window=all` opt-out; all 5 PWA hooks + Mac CLI + smoke test migrated; Thoughts tab shows `This week · {range}` header with search→`all time` swap



**Delivered in v3.1:**
- **Phase 83 Menu Bar Redesign** — DailyBriefMonitor stripped to print-scheduler-only; schedule config lives in PWA Settings persisted via API; Dock-less via LSUIElement
- **Phase 84 Browser Extension** — Chrome + Safari extension for one-click page-URL capture to POST /v1/thoughts
- **Phase 86 Split Brief Schedule** — Server generate cron (user TZ, 10-min dedupe, 7d retention, SIGTERM teardown); Mac CLI pull-only with exit-2 staleness sentinel; PWA Settings two-card UI + timezone picker; StatusChecker log-marker inference wires external CLI runs into the menubar
- **Phase 87 Vigil App Icons** — Full PWA icon set (192/256/384/512/maskable + favicon.svg/ico + apple-touch); Mac AppIcon.icns generated from brand PDF master; LSUIElement regression guard preserved

**Deferred to v3.2:**
- Phase 85 iOS Shortcut — Shortcuts.app bugs (note-input dialog refuses typing on macOS; silent "uploaded" success branch)
- Phase 80 Gmail Server Service — Blocked on ServiceNow API token from IT

**Shipped cumulatively:** v1.0–v3.1. Full PWA at app.vigilhub.io. Vigil Core API on Railway (Node/Hono/Drizzle/Postgres) with bearer auth + HTTPS. Server-side PDF generation (PDFKit 3-page). Mac menubar thin client + Even G2 glasses plugin + browser extension. OAuth foundation (Calendar + Gmail scopes, JWT nonce survives rolling deploys).

## Current Milestone: v3.2 Freshness & Capture Parity

**Goal:** Keep Vigil's daily picture accurate by aging out stale data, and bring non-Mac users to capture parity via the browser extension.

**Target features:**
- Weekly thought rollover (Wed–Tue view window; older data searchable + Chat-accessible)
- 7-day scope for Insights + Therapy analysis
- Server-side persistence for Insights + Therapy; Chat auto-resume last session
- Tasks tab status filter (Open default; toggle Done/All)
- Work Order auto-archive (Gmail-imported after 7d; completed after 7d; archived view)
- Brief PDF cleanup (de-duplicate Tasks section, Affirmation → bottom of Page 1, 7-day scope)
- Browser extension = full quick-capture (thought + triage, not just URL)
- Phase 81 UAT retest — iOS PWA standalone OAuth real-device verification

**Key context:**
- Phase 85 (iOS Shortcut) held — revisit in v3.3+
- Phase 80 (Gmail Server Service) remains deferred until ServiceNow API token
- Wednesday is the rollover anchor (ADHD clean-slate rhythm)
- No hard deletes — aging is view/scope only; everything stays in DB

## What This Is

An ambient AI life assistant built for ADHD brains. A native macOS app (formerly Jarvis) with frictionless text/voice/image capture, Claude AI auto-triage, therapy intelligence, tags/favorites/linking, a SwiftUI dashboard, and a daily printed PDF brief. Now a multi-client platform deployed to production: Vigil Core API (Node.js/Hono/Drizzle/PostgreSQL) runs on Railway, the Mac app connects to the production server with bearer token auth, and Even G2 smart glasses provide ambient glanceable display of work orders, reminders, and affirmations.

## Core Value

Capture every thought with zero friction and have the system organize it for you — so nothing falls through the cracks and your brain can let go.

### Active (v3.2)

- [ ] Weekly thought rollover — Thoughts tab shows current week (Wed–Tue); older remains searchable + Chat-accessible
- [ ] 7-day analysis window — Insights + Therapy scoped to last 7 days of thoughts
- [ ] Server-side persistence — Insights + Therapy cached on server; Chat auto-resumes last session
- [ ] Tasks tab status filter — default Open; toggle Done / All
- [ ] Work Order auto-archive — Gmail-imported after 7d; completed after 7d; "Show archived" toggle
- [ ] Brief PDF cleanup — de-duplicate Tasks section, Affirmation → bottom of Page 1, reflow; brief respects 7-day window
- [ ] Browser extension quick-capture — rewrite URL-only → thought capture + triage, mirroring Mac menu bar
- [ ] iOS PWA standalone OAuth real-device retest — close Phase 81 UAT gap on live Railway deploy

### Out of Scope

- Native iOS/Android app — PWA covers cross-platform access; native mobile only if PWA proves insufficient
- Real-time voice assistant — this is capture-and-review, not conversational
- Replacing the physical notebook — digital complements the traveler's notebook, doesn't replace it
- Multi-user support — build after Vigil Core is proven on a server
- Android XR native — WebXR/PWA first; native Kotlin only if spatial features needed
- ServiceNow API integration — blocked on IT token; work orders stay IMAP-sourced until unblocked
- Auto-detection of project assignment from photo content — manual assignment works; auto-routing is future
- Work order → project linkage — projects are personal only; work orders stay separate

## Constraints

- **Platform**: macOS 14+ (Sonoma), Swift 6.2, SwiftUI; PWA via React/Vite
- **AI Provider**: Anthropic Claude API (already integrated)
- **Build System**: Swift Package Manager (existing setup)
- **Data Storage**: Production PostgreSQL on Railway (Drizzle ORM, tsvector FTS)
- **Voice Capture**: SFSpeechRecognizer for on-device transcription; external pocket recorder for mobile
- **Physical Output**: Daily PDF must remain printable and glueable into traveler's notebook

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Native macOS app (not web) | User is all-Apple; deeper system integration; DailyBrief already Swift/SwiftUI | ✓ Good |
| Pocket voice recorder for mobile capture | Phone is too much friction while driving; one-button press solves ADHD capture barrier | ✓ Good |
| Claude for AI categorization | Already integrated for affirmations; natural language understanding for thought triage | ✓ Good |
| Local-first data storage (GRDB/SQLite) | Privacy (therapy notes, personal thoughts); no cloud dependency; simplicity | ✓ Good |
| Drop Apple Reminders — use Vigil task thoughts | Vigil captures tasks natively; Reminders was redundant and Mac-only | ✓ Good — decided v3.0 |
| Carbon API for global hotkey | No Accessibility permissions required; reliable system-wide capture | ✓ Good |
| SFSpeechRecognizer over WhisperKit | WhisperKit crashes on Intel Macs (CoreML MLMultiArray segfault); SFSpeech needs no model downloads | ✓ Good |
| Fire-and-forget triage | Instant capture UX; background categorization doesn't block user | ✓ Good |
| Dashboard toolbar for audio/image import | Floating NSPanel + NSOpenPanel incompatible; dashboard provides stable window context | ✓ Good |
| GoogleCalendarService in JarvisCore | Cross-target access needed (both CLI and menu bar app use it) | ✓ Good |
| LaunchAgent over Login Items | More control over lifecycle, single architecture | ✓ Good |
| DispatchSource for folder watching | Low overhead, immediate file detection without polling | ✓ Good |
| CloudKit over Supabase for sync | Native Apple integration, no server costs, privacy-first | ✓ Good |
| Last-write-wins conflict resolution | Simple, predictable for single-user multi-Mac sync | ✓ Good |
| CoreGraphics for image conversion | No external dependencies, handles HEIC/TIFF/BMP natively | ✓ Good |
| OAuth2 device code flow for IMAP auth | Headless-friendly (no browser redirect needed); works in CLI and menu bar contexts; Azure AD compatible | ✓ Good |
| Actor-based WorkOrderPrioritizer with daily cache | Hash-based cache invalidation avoids redundant API calls; actor isolation for thread safety | ✓ Good |

| Early close of v1.4 to pivot to Vigil platform | Even G2 smart glasses SDK launched 2026-04-03; first-mover window for ambient AI + ADHD | ✓ Good |
| Rename from Jarvis to Vigil | Jarvis has Marvel/Disney IP conflict, hundreds of existing apps; Vigil fits the product promise | — Pending |
| Hono over Express for Vigil Core API | Lightweight, TypeScript-first, edge-ready; minimal boilerplate | ✓ Good |
| better-sqlite3 for direct Jarvis DB access | No ORM overhead, shared SQLite file between Mac app and API | ✓ Good |
| Protocol abstraction for Mac app migration | ThoughtRepository + AI service protocols enable gradual migration without breaking existing code | ✓ Good |
| Config toggle (vigil.useAPI) for dual mode | Allowed testing API backend while keeping local fallback; retired in v2.2 | ✓ Good — served its purpose |
| snake_case config keys for cross-platform compat | Swift JSONEncoder requires snake_case; discovered during integration testing | ✓ Good |
| Localhost-only for v2.0 | Avoids auth/deployment complexity; proves architecture before scaling | ✓ Good — enabled confident v2.1 deployment |
| Drizzle ORM over raw SQL for PostgreSQL | Type-safe queries, migration tooling, connection pooling built-in | ✓ Good |
| Railway over self-hosted VPS | Managed Postgres addon, GitHub CI/CD, zero DevOps overhead | ✓ Good |
| SHA-256 hashed bearer tokens (vk_ prefix) | Simple auth model, no session management needed for API-to-API calls | ✓ Good |
| Keep Railway default domain | vigil-core-production.up.railway.app with HTTPS included; custom domain unnecessary for now | — Pending |
| In-memory rate limiting over Redis | Single-instance deployment; no external dependency needed at current scale | ✓ Good |
| Programmatic migrations on deploy | Drizzle migrate() runs idempotently on every Railway deploy; no manual step | ✓ Good |

| PDFLayout computed from PDFConfig | Flat struct with all dimensions, drives all renderers; notebook preset hardcodes 270x540 | ✓ Good |
| maxTokens 1024 for chat | ADHD-friendly concise replies from Claude | ✓ Good |
| Retire local GRDB/CloudKit/AI in v2.2 | API backend proven stable in v2.1; dual code paths were maintenance burden | ✓ Good |

| Server-side PDF rendering | Removes Mac dependency for brief generation; any client can get briefs | — Pending |
| HTML+CSS to PDF over CoreText port | Easier to maintain, iterate on layout; Puppeteer/similar in Node | — Pending |
